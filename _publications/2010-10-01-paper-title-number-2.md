This paper explores whether early-stage investors are influenced by the gender composition of startup teams. Results show that women-founded startups receive more investor interest but less funding. Using state-level maternity benefits as an instrument, the paper identifies a negative funding premium for women-founded startups. It further uncovers industry-level disparities and instances where women-founded startups outperform their male counterparts in high-performing sectors.
