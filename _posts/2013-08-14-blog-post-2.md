As I near the completion of my PhD in Economics, I've been reflecting on the academic highs and personal growth that came along the way.

Advice for future PhDs

Stay connected to mentors, say yes to opportunities early, and donâ€™t underestimate the power of teaching in shaping your clarity of thought.
